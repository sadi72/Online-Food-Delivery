 SRS Document in IEEE Format 
Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the Online Food Delivery & Restaurant Management System. This system allows customers to order food from multiple restaurants, track orders in real-time, make secure payments, and rate their food. Restaurants can manage menus, process orders, and assign delivery personnel. Delivery personnel can accept delivery requests and update order status.

•	Browsing restaurants and menus
•	Placing and tracking orders
•	Secure online payments
•	Menu management for restaurants
•	Delivery assignment and status updates
•	Order history and rating
